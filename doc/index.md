#Introduction

IGV-web is an embeddable interactive genome visualization component written
in JavaScript and CSS.  It is based on the [Integrative Genomics Viewer
(IGV)](http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv), and developed by the same team.

Many genomic file formats are supported, including BAM, VCF, BED, and GFF,
as well as the [Global Alliance API](http://ga4gh.org).
